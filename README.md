# Topographic Convolutional Sparse Coding

![](./trained_models/RF.png)

This is an implementation of a convolutional sparse coding model with an extra linear layer on the
end, which results in a topographic ordering of filters.

## Run
To run the program:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd src/scripts
python train.py
```
To see a list of available hyperparameters to change:
```python
python train.py -h
```
A checkpoint of the model is saved every 10 epochs to `trained_models`. To see the tensorboard logs:
```python
tensorboard --logdir=runs
```
